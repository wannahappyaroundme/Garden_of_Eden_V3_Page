    },
    "q1": "Is my data really 100% private?",
    "a1": "Yes! All AI processing happens locally on your machine. No data ever leaves your computer. We use AES-256 encryption for your database, and the code is open-source (MIT License) so you can verify this yourself. Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero cloud uploads.",
    "q2": "How can it be free forever?",
    "a2": "Eden is built as a passion project with an MIT License. There are no server costs since everything runs locally. We believe AI companionship and assistance should be accessible to everyone without subscription barriers or privacy compromises.",
    "q3": "What makes Eden different from ChatGPT or Claude?",
    "a3": "Eden is designed for emotional companionship first, not just productivity. It eliminates loneliness for solo developers with friend-like support. Plus: 100% privacy, works offline, learns your style (17 persona parameters), deep system integration, and completely free. Quality-wise, we score 80.5% on HumanEval (vs GPT-4: 85%, Claude: 88%) - enterprise-grade AI without cloud dependency.",
    "q4": "What languages does it support?",
    "a4": "The interface supports Korean (한국어) and English with full cultural localization including Korean honorifics (경어, 존칭). The AI understands and responds in 99 languages thanks to Whisper Large V3 and Llama 3.1's multilingual capabilities. It even handles code-switching between languages naturally.",
    "q5": "Can I use it offline?",
    "a5": "Absolutely! After the initial model download (~16.5GB), Eden works completely offline. No internet connection required for daily use. Perfect for confidential work, travel, or unstable internet connections.",
    "q6": "How do I customize the AI's personality?",
    "a6": "Navigate to Settings > Persona and adjust any of the 17 parameters like formality, humor, verbosity, emoji usage, empathy, and more. Choose from 6 pre-built personas (Eden, Strict Mentor, Cheerful Friend, Professional Assistant, Coding Sensei, Custom) or create your own. Use thumbs up/down feedback to train it to your preferences via gradient descent optimization.",
    "q7": "What is RAG memory and how does it work?",
    "a7": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is how Eden remembers you. Every conversation is stored locally in a ChromaDB vector database. When you ask something, Eden searches semantically through past conversations (even from months ago) to provide context-aware, personalized responses. It's like having a friend who never forgets your preferences, projects, or past discussions.",
    "q8": "What if I encounter bugs or issues?",
    "a8": "Please report bugs on our GitHub Issues page. As an open-source project at 85% completion (Phase 8: Launch), we're actively improving and value your feedback. The community is friendly and responsive!",
    "q9": "Can I contribute to the project?",
    "a9": "Yes! We welcome contributions. Check our GitHub repository for contribution guidelines. Whether it's code, documentation, bug reports, or feature suggestions - help us reach 100% and beyond! MIT License means it's truly open for everyone.",
    "q10": "Why is Solo Developer the primary target user?",
    "a10": "Eden was created to solve the loneliness epidemic among solo developers and remote workers. Working from home can be isolating - Eden provides genuine companionship while you code, celebrates your wins, offers comfort during frustrations, and enhances productivity. It's not just an assistant; it's a friend by your side.",
