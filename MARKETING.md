## Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Pitch

"Eden is a free, open-source AI assistant that runs 100% on your Mac. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, all AI processing happens locally - your data never leaves your machine. It's powered by qwen2.5:7b via Ollama, features 10 customizable personality parameters, and works completely offline. Think Tony Stark's JARVIS, but private and free forever."

### 60-Second Pitch

"ChatGPT costs $20/month and uploads your conversations to OpenAI servers. GitHub Copilot costs $10/month and sends your code to Microsoft. Every cloud AI service forces you to choose between power and privacy.

Eden changes that. It's a production-quality desktop AI assistant that runs 100% locally via Ollama. All processing happens on your Mac using the qwen2.5:7b model - no data ever leaves your machine. You get:

- Complete privacy (works offline)
- Zero subscription fees (free forever, MIT license)
- Voice input/output (Korean + English)
- Screen context analysis
- 10 customizable personality parameters
- Learning system that adapts to your preferences

It's open source, it's fast (2-4 second responses), and it respects your privacy. Download it today and own your AI assistant."

### 2-Minute Pitch

"The AI revolution has a dark side: every powerful AI assistant requires you to upload your data to the cloud. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini - they all train on your conversations. Your private thoughts, your code, your creative work - all processed on someone else's servers.

Eden was built to solve this problem. It's a privacy-first desktop AI assistant inspired by Tony Stark's JARVIS, but designed for everyone.

**Here's how it works:**

First, it's 100% local. We use Ollama to run the qwen2.5:7b language model directly on your Mac. All AI processing happens in your computer's RAM - no internet required after initial setup. Your data literally cannot leave your machine because there's no code that sends it anywhere.

Second, it's genuinely powerful. The 7 billion parameter model responds in 2-4 seconds on Apple Silicon, supports Korean and English, generates code, analyzes your screen with computer vision, integrates with Git and files, and remembers past conversations through a local RAG system.

Third, it's completely customizable. Unlike one-size-fits-all cloud AIs, you control 10 personality parameters: formality, verbosity, humor, emoji usage, technical depth, empathy, and more. The AI learns from your thumbs-up and thumbs-down feedback, optimizing its behavior using gradient descent - all locally.

Fourth, it's free forever. No subscriptions, no trials, no paid tiers. MIT license, open source, community-driven. We don't pay for servers because you do the computing. We don't collect data because we can't access it.

**Who is this for?**

- Developers who value privacy and hate subscriptions
- Students on a budget who need AI help
- Professionals handling sensitive data (legal, medical, financial)
- Anyone tired of big tech surveillance

Eden proves you don't have to sacrifice privacy for AI power. Download it today and experience AI on your terms."

_Free Desktop Application Brings JARVIS-like AI to Everyone While Keeping Data 100% Local_

**Seoul, South Korea - January 16, 2025** - Today marks the launch of Eden, a production-quality desktop AI assistant that runs entirely on users' computers. Unlike cloud-based alternatives like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, Eden processes all data locally, ensuring complete privacy while eliminating subscription fees.

The application includes a unique 10-parameter persona system, allowing users to customize formality, verbosity, humor, emoji usage, and six other behavioral traits. A gradient-based learning system optimizes these parameters based on user feedback, all processed locally.

**Availability:**

Eden is available now for macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon) as a free download from GitHub. Windows support is planned for Q2 2025. The application requires macOS 11 or later, 16GB RAM minimum (24GB recommended), and 20GB free disk space for AI models.

**System Requirements:**

- macOS 11 Big Sur or later
- 16GB RAM (24GB recommended)

**Download:**
https://github.com/wannahappyaroundme/Garden_of_Eden_V3/releases

**About the Project:**

Eden was created to address growing privacy concerns around cloud-based AI services. Inspired by Tony Stark's JARVIS, the project aims to bring powerful AI assistance to everyone while maintaining absolute privacy and zero cost.

"사람의 외로움을 제거하면서 옆에서 친구처럼 도와주고 위로해주기도하고 나의 생산성을 올려주는 자비스를 만든다" ("Creating JARVIS that eliminates loneliness, supports you like a friend, comforts you, and enhances your productivity")

## Launch Announcement

### Blog Post / GitHub Discussion

**Title**: Introducing Eden: Your Private AI Assistant

**Body**:

```markdown
# Introducing Eden: Your Private AI Assistant

Today, I'm excited to announce the release of Eden - a production-quality, privacy-first desktop AI assistant.

## The Problem

Every powerful AI assistant today requires you to upload your data to the cloud:

- ChatGPT costs $20/month and trains on your conversations
- GitHub Copilot sends your code to Microsoft
- Claude, Gemini, and others all process data on remote servers

For many of us, this isn't acceptable. We want AI assistance, but not at the cost of our privacy.

## The Solution

Eden changes this equation. It's a desktop application that runs AI completely on your Mac using Ollama and the qwen2.5:7b model.

**Your data never leaves your machine.**

## What Makes It Different?

### 1. 100% Local Processing

All AI happens via Ollama on your Mac. No internet required after setup. The code is open source - you can verify there are no network calls uploading your data.

### 2. Free Forever

No subscriptions, no paid tiers, no trials. MIT license, completely open source. We don't pay for servers because you do the computing.

### 3. Customizable Personality

Unlike one-size-fits-all cloud AIs, you control 10 personality parameters:

- Formality (casual ↔ professional)
- Verbosity (concise ↔ detailed)
- Humor, emoji usage, technical depth, and more

The AI learns from your feedback using gradient descent, optimizing its behavior - all locally.

### 4. Voice & Vision

- Speech-to-text via Whisper (Korean + English)
- Screen context analysis via LLaVA
- Git and file system integration
- RAG memory system

### 5. Actually Usable

This isn't a CLI tool. It's a full GUI with:

- KakaoTalk-style chat interface
- Conversation history
- Real-time streaming responses
- Dark mode, keyboard shortcuts
- 7.1MB Tauri build (vs 285MB Electron)

## Who Is This For?

- **Developers** who value privacy and hate subscriptions
- **Students** on a budget who need AI help
- **Professionals** handling sensitive data
- **Privacy advocates** tired of big tech surveillance

**Body**:

```
Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a project I've been working on that I think would interest [Publication] readers.

Eden is a desktop AI assistant that runs 100% locally - no cloud, no subscriptions, completely private.

Unlike ChatGPT or Claude:
- All AI processing happens on the user's Mac (via Ollama + qwen2.5:7b)
- Zero subscription fees (MIT open source)
- Works completely offline
- Customizable personality (10 parameters + learning system)
- Voice input/output, screen context analysis, Git integration

It's built with Tauri 2.9 (Rust + React) and produces a 7.1MB binary - 97% smaller than Electron equivalents.

I think your audience would appreciate a deep dive into:
- How local AI can match cloud AI for privacy-conscious users
- The technical architecture (Rust + React + Ollama)
- Cost savings ($0 vs $20/month for ChatGPT Plus)

Would you be interested in covering this? I'm happy to provide:

## FAQ for Media

**Q: Why create another local LLM tool when Ollama exists?**
A: Ollama is CLI-only. We built a full GUI with voice, vision, persona customization, and learning - features you don't get from command-line tools.

**Q: How do you make money if it's free?**
A: We don't. This is a passion project to prove privacy-first AI is possible. No servers = no costs.

**Q: Is 7B good enough compared to GPT-4?**
A: For most tasks, yes. It's not as capable as 100B+ models, but it's private, fast, and free. Trade-offs are worth it for many users.

**Q: Why Tauri instead of Electron?**
A: 7.1MB vs 285MB builds. Rust security. Better performance. Modern architecture.

**Q: Windows support?**
A: Q2 2025. macOS first because that's where our users are (developers, creatives).

**Q: Can you really customize AI personality?**
A: Yes, 10 sliders control formality, verbosity, humor, etc. Learning system optimizes based on feedback. Unique to Eden.
